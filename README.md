Ninja Flipper is an eclectic arcade platform-type game, loosely based on Telerik Academy exam experiences. 

The ninja character is controlled with the arrow keys. The game can be paused and saved. There is a How-To tutorial, accessed from the title screen.

[Blah-blah thorougher description of gameplay and design]

##General Requirements

The game implements:

  - Phaser, an HTML5 game development framework.
  - Raphael, JavaScript Library for facilitating work with SVG.

The game is supported in Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer 9/10/11, Opera and Apple Safari. Raphael SVG graphics lybrary is used for the menu screen and the page background. For the game engine and canvas graphics the game employs the Phaser framework's HTML5 Canvas renderer. 

##Additional Requirements

The game is implemented with self-documenting methods and files by complying with recommended naming practices. The code follows JavaScript prototypal OOP convention for data encapsulation and abstraction, providing high cohesion and loose coupling.
GitHub is used for source control and project hosting.

##Optional requirements

DOM manipulations are used for the implementation of the prehistory screens.
